# Base class

# Car class inherits from Vehicle

# Function to demonstrate polymorphism
def show_vehicle_move(vehicle):
    vehicle.move()  # Calls the move method of the object passed as argument

# Create objects for each vehicle

# Demonstrating polymorphism
show_vehicle_move(car)    # Output: Driving 🚗
show_vehicle_move(plane)  # Output: Flying ✈️
show_vehicle_move(bike)   # Output: Riding 🚴
